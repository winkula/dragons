    <h1>Rules</h1>

    <p>
      This is a puzzle about dragons. Try to find out, where the dragons are
      hiding on the grid. A square can either be a dragon
      <Grid class="grid-inline" :grid="dragon" small></Grid>, fire
      <Grid class="grid-inline" :grid="fire" small></Grid>or air
      <Grid class="grid-inline" :grid="air" small></Grid>. The grid must be
      filled completely in order to win the game.
    </p>
    <p>There are only three rules:</p>

    <h2>The territory rule</h2>
    <p>
      Every dragon has its own territory (the eight squares surrounding him).
      <strong>Inside one's territory there can't be other dragons</strong>. You
      can mark squares where dragons are impossible with a point
      <Grid class="grid-inline" :grid="point" small></Grid>.
    </p>
    <Grid :grid="example1" small></Grid>

    <h2>The fire rule</h2>
    <p>
      Dragons don't like each other and they spit fire when being provoked.
      That's why squares of
      <strong>overlapping territories must always be fire</strong> - but only
      then.
    </p>
    <Grid :grid="example2" small></Grid>

    <h2>The survive rule</h2>
    <p>
      Dragons need air to survive. That's why
      <strong>at least two</strong> of the four
      <strong>directly adjacent squares</strong> (not diagonal) of a dragon
      <strong>must be air</strong>.
