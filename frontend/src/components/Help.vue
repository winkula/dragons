    <h1>Rules</h1>

    <p>
      This is a puzzle about dragons. Try to find out, where the dragons are hiding on the grid. A square can either be a dragon
      <Grid class="grid-inline" :grid="dragon" small></Grid>, fire
      <Grid class="grid-inline" :grid="fire" small></Grid>or empty
      <Grid class="grid-inline" :grid="empty" small></Grid>.
    </p>
    <p>There are only three rules:</p>

    <h2>The territory rule</h2>
    <p>
      Every dragon has its own territory - the eight squares surrounding him.
      <strong>Inside one's territory there can't be other dragons</strong>. The game automatically marks territory squares with a point
      <Grid class="grid-inline" :grid="point" small></Grid>.
    </p>
    <Grid :grid="example1" small></Grid>

    <h2>The fight rule</h2>
    <p>
      Dragons don't like each other. That's why squares of
      <strong>overlapping territories must always be fire</strong> - but only then.
    </p>
    <Grid :grid="example2" small></Grid>

    <h2>The survive rule</h2>
    <p>
      Dragons like it hot - but they also need air to survive.
      That's why
      <strong>at least two</strong> of the four
      <strong>directly adjacent squares</strong> of a dragon
      <strong>must be empty</strong>.
      Squares outside the grid don't count as "empty".
    </p>
    <p>In this example, the survive rule is satisfied - two of the four directly adjacent squares are empty:</p>
    <Grid :grid="example3_1" small></Grid>
    <p>Here, the survive rule is violated - only one of the two directly adjacent squares are empty:</p>
    <Grid :grid="example3_2" small></Grid>
